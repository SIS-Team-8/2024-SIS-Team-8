## Development Conventions

### Branch Name

* `[developer_name]/[task_name]` e.g. dave/style-summarisation-button

### Pull Request Reviews

* As a reviewer, only leave comments, approvals or change requests - Let the PR creator administrate (e.g. merge, delete the branch) the PR.
* Each PR will require at least **2** approvals
* Pay attention to merge conflicts, they must be resolved before being merged.

### Documentation

* Leave comments for each function in regards to their purpose, and possibly an explanation of the process.
* Don't be afraid to leave small notes and comments whilst developing.
